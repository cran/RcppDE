Description: An efficient C++ based implementation of the 'DEoptim'
 function which performs global optimization by differential evolution.
 Its creation was motivated by trying to see if the old approximation "easier,
 shorter, faster: pick any two" could in fact be extended to achieving all
 three goals while moving the code from plain old C to modern C++.  The
 initial version did in fact do so, but a good part of the gain was due to
 an implicit code review which eliminated a few inefficiencies which have
 since been eliminated in 'DEoptim'.
